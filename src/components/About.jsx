    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Since childhood, I have always loved drawing, making creative things, and doing craft work.
      I used to spend a lot of time trying to draw freehand, but in the beginning, my drawings
      were not very good. Even then, I never gave up and kept practicing.
      <br /><br />
      Later, I learned about the grid method and started using it in my drawings. This helped me
      draw better and get the right shapes and sizes. I also loved watching YouTube videos about
      sketching and art. I learned many tips and tricks from those videos and slowly improved my skills.
      <br /><br />
      Now, art is not just a hobby for me â€” it is a beautiful way to share my feelings, thoughts,
      and ideas through my drawings.
